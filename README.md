Two projects:

1. Distributional Modelling project.
Model the unconditional return distribution of 2 stocks over different time horizons (daily, 5-day, 10-day, 30-day return) using different distribution candidates (normal distribution, t-distribution and variance gamma distribution).

2. AR-GARCH, VaR and Portfolio Selection project.
Use the AR (1)-GARCH (1,1) model to estimate the return series of a portfolio of 4 stocks. The models provide recommendations on (i) how to estimate the portfolio VaR and (ii) how to optimise the portfolio weights by maximising expected daily returns and minimising daily 99% VaR.
